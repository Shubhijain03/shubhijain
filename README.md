Project Report: Making a Website to Learn Basic HTML

1. Introduction:
This project was about creating a website to help people learn the basics of HTML. The website talks about things like understanding what HTML is, adding style, making tables, using different tags, putting
pictures and videos, and creating forms. We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the website fun and interesting.

2. Project Goals:
Our project had a few main goals:
Make a website that's easy for beginners to learn HTML.Talk about different things step by step so it's not confusing.Make the website look nice with colors and stuff using CSS.Use JavaScript to add quizzes,
examples, and things that move.Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the website work well.

3. What We Used:
To build our project, we majorly used these things:
i)HTML (HyperText Markup Language): We used this to organize what goes on the website.
ii)CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): This helped us make the website look good by choosing how it looks.
iii)JavaScript: We used this to make the website fun, like adding quizzes and making things change when you click on them.

4. How I Did It:
Our project had these parts:
4.1.Making the Website with HTML:
We used HTML to make the different sections on the website. Each part talks about a different thing, like what HTML is, how to make things look good, making tables, using tags, pictures, videos, and forms.
4.2.Making it Look Nice with CSS:
CSS helped us make the website look better. We used it to pick colors and where things go so it's easy to look at.
4.3. Making it Fun with JavaScript:
JavaScript made our website more interesting. We used it for quizzes, interactive examples, and things that show more when you click on them. It also helped pictures and videos load faster.
4.4. Making it Easy for People:
We wanted people to like using our website, so we did these things:

Moving Around: We made a menu which is being created using list  so people can go to different parts easily.
Making it Clear: We used big titles and smaller titles to show what's what.
Fits on Phones: Our website works on different screens so it's not hard to see.
5. What We Learned:
Our project helped beginners learn HTML better. With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we learned how to make things look good and fun on a website.

6. What's Next:
If we keep going with our project, we could add harder things to learn, like more advanced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript stuff. We could also let people practice coding and talk to others about what they're learning.

7. Where We Got Help:
We looked at some tutorials and websites to help us with our project.
